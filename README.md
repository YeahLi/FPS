# Kill Zombies
It is a 3D FPS Game developed with Unity. In the period of developing, I learned how to move a physical character and control the camera to follow with it. The game involves some advanced techniques such as the collision detection based on ray cast, "Mecanim" Animation System, target homing road, etc.
